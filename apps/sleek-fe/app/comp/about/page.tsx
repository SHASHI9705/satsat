              <p className="text-beige-800 leading-relaxed">
                SleekRoad was born from a simple observation: local marketplaces had become cluttered, unsafe, and
                frustrating. Students struggled to find trusted buyers for textbooks. Neighbors couldn't easily discover
                great furniture down the street. And too often, users faced scams, spam, and poor experiences.
              </p>
              <p className="text-beige-800 leading-relaxed">
                We set out to build something different—a marketplace that feels clean, modern, and safe. A place where
                communities can buy, sell, and connect without the noise. Where trust is built into every interaction,
                and the experience is delightful from start to finish.

              <p className="text-beige-800 leading-relaxed">
                <strong>To create the world's most trusted and beautiful local marketplace.</strong> We believe buying and
                selling locally should be simple, safe, and joyful. We're building tools that empower communities—from
                college campuses to neighborhoods—to discover value, reduce waste, and connect with people nearby.
